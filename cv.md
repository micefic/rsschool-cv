### About me
I always wanted to tie my life to languages, so I completed my linguistic studies at the HSE. There I learned about a very up-and-coming language: the programming language _*Python*_. After studying it for two years, I realised that **it wasn't the way to go**. 
Upon  graduation, I realised that my goal is to learn how to make websites, as it is a promising and relevant field. In my opinion, RS is the best start in this direction.
### Skills
